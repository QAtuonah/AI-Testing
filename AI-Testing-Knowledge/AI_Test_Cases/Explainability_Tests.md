# 🧠 Explainability Testing

Verifying that model decisions can be interpreted and justified.

## 🔍 Test Case 1: SHAP Value Explanation Consistency
- **Objective:** Ensure SHAP values consistently reflect model decisions.
- **Steps:**
  1. Use SHAP to generate explanations on multiple samples.
  2. Validate feature importance ranking against domain knowledge.
- **Expected Result:** SHAP outputs align with expected logic and consistency.

## 🔍 Test Case 2: Check for Black Box Failures
- **Objective:** Identify if model fails without explanation (e.g., complex nonlinear jumps).
- **Steps:**
  1. Feed small input variations.
- **Expected Result:** Reasonable, explainable output changes.

## 🔍 Test Case 3: Validate Explanations Across Classes
- **Objective:** Confirm that each class has distinct explanation patterns.
- **Steps:**
  1. Run SHAP or LIME for different predicted classes.
- **Expected Result:** Different classes should emphasize different features.

## 🔍 Test Case 4: Explanation Alignment with Domain Experts
- **Objective:** Have human experts validate explanation logic.
- **Steps:**
  1. Present top contributing features per prediction.
  2. Ask for expert review.
- **Expected Result:** High agreement rate between model explanation and expert intuition.
