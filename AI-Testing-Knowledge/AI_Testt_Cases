# ✅ ML Model Validation Test Cases

These test cases are designed to validate whether the ML model is performing correctly and consistently under different scenarios.

## 🔍 Test Case 1: Validate Model Output Type
- **Objective:** Ensure the model returns a prediction in the expected format (e.g., label or probability).
- **Steps:**
  1. Load the trained model.
  2. Send a sample input (from known dataset).
- **Expected Result:** Model returns output in the correct format (e.g., float between 0 and 1 for probability, or valid label for classification).

## 🔍 Test Case 2: Handle Null or Invalid Inputs
- **Objective:** Verify model behavior with incomplete or malformed input.
- **Steps:**
  1. Submit input with missing fields or invalid types.
- **Expected Result:** Model handles gracefully (error message or fallback behavior, no crash).

## 🔍 Test Case 3: Verify Consistency Across Environments
- **Objective:** Ensure the same input gives same output across dev/stage/prod.
- **Steps:**
  1. Run the same sample input in different environments.
- **Expected Result:** Identical prediction outputs or within acceptable margin.

## 🔍 Test Case 4: Edge Case Input Testing
- **Objective:** Test model behavior with borderline values or extremes.
- **Steps:**
  1. Feed inputs with max/min allowed values or outliers.
- **Expected Result:** Model handles edge inputs correctly and without unexpected results.

## 🔍 Test Case 5: Model Threshold Validation
- **Objective:** Confirm classification threshold behaves as expected.
- **Steps:**
  1. Run input with predicted probability close to threshold (e.g., 0.49, 0.5, 0.51).
- **Expected Result:** Classification changes as per threshold rules.
