# Model Validation – Sentiment Analysis

## Objective
Validate if the sentiment classification model accurately detects positive and negative feedback.

## Test Scenarios

1. Validate predictions for clearly positive/negative sentences.
2. Check probability values are within [0.0, 1.0].
3. Verify classification report (precision, recall, F1).
4. Test robustness on short and long inputs.

## Expected Results
- Accuracy ≥ 85%
- Misclassifications limited to ambiguous inputs
- Probability outputs consistent with text tone
